<h2>Why IT & DevOps?</h2>
<p> Overall, IT is a constantly changing field, with more to be learned and discovered every year. This continual
    growth and freshness keeps a career interesting even after years of work in the same role. DevOps is a prime
    example of this. It’s at the forefront of a new wave of efficiency and automation that will likely have far
    reaching consequences. Consequences that I’m excited to discover and explore over my career. </p>
